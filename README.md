# Node.js Notes Project

This Node.js project includes HTML files for different pages (`Not Found`, `About`, and `Homepage`) with corresponding CSS styles. Additionally, the project features several Node.js scripts showcasing various functionalities:

1. **Event Emitter:**

   - Utilizes the `EventEmitter` class to create a custom event emitter.
   - Emits and listens for a custom event named 'Event.'

2. **File System Manipulation:**

   - Uses the `fs` module to create folders, write to files, append to files, read files, and rename files.

3. **Simple HTTP Server:**

   - Creates a basic HTTP server using the `http` module that responds with 'Hello World' on port 5000.

4. **OS Module:**

   - Retrieves and displays information about the operating system, such as platform, CPU architecture, free and total memory, home directory, and uptime.

5. **Path Module:**

   - Demonstrates various functionalities of the `path` module, including extracting the base file name, directory name, file extension, and creating a path object.

6. **URL Module:**
   - Uses the `url` module to parse and display information about a sample URL, including serialization, host details, pathname, serialized query, and parameter manipulation.

These scripts showcase fundamental Node.js concepts and can serve as a starting point for understanding and building more complex applications.
